`Shorten` is a simple and efficient URL shortening service that allows you to create compact, easy-to-share links from long URLs.  

## Workflow

- The system uses a **load balancer** to distribute traffic and route requests to backend servers.  
- To prioritize fast responses to users, the system employs a **message queue (RabbitMQ)** to:  
  - Store messages and tasks from backend servers.  
  - Allow **background workers** to process them later.  
- The system leverages **background workers** to perform tasks such as:  
  - Updating IDs.  
  - Verifying URLs.  
  - (Details are provided in the Background Process section.)  
- The system uses **PostgreSQL** as a high-performance database to store:  
  - Information about short URLs (e.g., unique IDs, original URLs, suspicious statuses, access counts).  
  - The last-used ID within defined ranges.  
- The system utilizes **Redis** as a highly available cache via Cluster deployment:  
  - Storing frequently accessed URLs.  
  - Acting as a "temporary memory" for newly created short URLs.
